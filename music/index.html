<H1>Music composed by John A. Krallmann</H1>
<P>
I have a <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrUlhMt2v-NTvbWMrVuUCFw">
YouTube channel</A> with some of the music I have composed.
</P>
<P>
This music was composed for my own enjoyment and is made available in
the hope that others will enjoy it too.
Most, though not all, of the pieces are good for relaxation.
In addition to the sheet music, each composition includes the input file,
in Mup format (Mup is a music publication program I co-authored, available
from <A HREF="http://www.arkkra.com">http://www.arkkra.com</A>),
as well as a MIDI file.
The MIDI files are generated from the input file, so do not include
all the nuances of expression of a real performance, but are sufficient to
get a general feel for each piece.
